# Daily-Todo

Daily-Todo is a small Application build on Node.js and lowdb in the Backend and Next.js and React in the Frontend.

# Idea

It's a regular Todo-App with a small twist. You can only create Items for your current date and you cant edit them later on. The Idea behind that is that you really focus on choosing you daily tasks wisely and not procastinating them.

# Getting Started

## Locally

### Backend

Go to the backend folder and enter

```
npm start
```

You should then be able to use the express server on port 5555

### Frontend

Go to the frontend folder and run

```
npm run build
```

If this is done follow up with

```
npm start
```

You can then open up your browser window and see the page on port 3000
